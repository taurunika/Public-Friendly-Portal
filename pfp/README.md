# CryOut
CryOut has been made with a motive to act as a connecting link between those who seek help and those who are capable of providing help. There are times when people are hesitant to approach the police in person and also often there are situations when the complaints do not reach the right people. This app has been made with a motive to minimse such incidents and thus make help readily available for all. Its built using HTML, CSS and PHP, along with some JQuery Plugins.
